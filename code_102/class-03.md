> There are lots of occasions when we
> need to use lists. HTML provides us with
> three different types:

* **Ordered** lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

* **Unordered** lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

* **Definition** lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

</ol>

## to create unOreder list

<ul>

</ul>

## to create Definition list

<dl>
<dt></dt> // This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).

<dd></dd> // This is used to contain theb definition.

</dl>

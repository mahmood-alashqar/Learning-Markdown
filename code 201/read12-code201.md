# charts  
## Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

## A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

## To see how to use chart.js we’re going to create a set of 3 graphs; one will show the number of buyers a fictional product has over the course of 6 months, this will be a line chart; the second will show which countries the customers come from, this will be the pie chart; finally we’ll use a bar chart to show profit over the period.

# Canvas API
## Basic usage of canvas
### A <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

> Note: If your renderings seem distorted, try specifying your width and height attributes explicitly in the <canvas> attributes, and not using CSS.

**Fallback content**

## The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.

## Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the <canvas> element. Browsers that don't support <canvas> will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support <canvas> will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.

## For example, we could provide a text description of the canvas content or provide a static image of the dynamically rendered content. This can look something like this:
```
<canvas id="stockGraph" width="150" height="150">
  current stock price: $3.15 + 0.15
</canvas>

<canvas id="clock" width="150" height="150">
  <img src="images/clock.png" width="150" height="150" alt=""/>
</canvas>

```

**Required </canvas> tag**

## As a consequence of the way fallback is provided, unlike the <img> element, the <canvas> element requires the closing tag (</canvas>). If this tag is not present, the rest of the document would be considered the fallback content and wouldn't be displayed.

## If fallback content is not needed, a simple <canvas id="foo" ...></canvas> is fully compatible with all browsers that support canvas at all.

# Drawing shapes with canvas

## You can  draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. 

*Rectangular shape example*

```
function draw() {
  var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  if (canvas.getContext) {
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    ctx.fillRect(25, 25, 100, 100);
    ctx.clearRect(45, 45, 60, 60);
    ctx.strokeRect(50, 50, 50, 50);
  }
}
```

# Applying styles and colors (*we used only the default line and fill styles*)

**A fillStyle example**

```
function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
      ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(' + Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * i) + ', ' +
                       Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * j) + ', 0)';
      ctx.fillRect(j * 25, i * 25, 25, 25);
    }
  }
}

```

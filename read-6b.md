# CSS : allow to the programmer tp control of the appearence of the web pages and thier contants.

## The key to understanding how CSS works is to
## imagine that there is an invisible box around
## every HTML element.

 #### Using CSS you can create Boxes(boarder,width,high,background-color,...etc.),
 #### Text(typefaces,size,color,...etc.),lists,tables,forms ,...etc. .
 

 ### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
 ### how the content of specified elements should be displayed.

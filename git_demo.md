## Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) allows clients to create mirrored repositories. 
## These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

### Git  can do : snapshots (and thats mean the Git is DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.)
and  because most necessary information can be found in local resources; so the Git is also local operation .
And its set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files.
and it can be tracking the files and any update on our files.

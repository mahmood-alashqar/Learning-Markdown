# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming What is the hardest thing about writing code?

## There are many common answers to this question:

* Learning a new technology
* Naming things
* Testing your code
* Debugging
* Fixing bugs
* Making software maintainable
* The list goes on and on.


> But when you look closer and look foucslly into this issue ,you will foud that  the single hardest thing about programming is learning the problem domain.

### but now thanks OOP you can create Very simple functionality, easily explainable, but most importantly, easily understood.

**By you  creating a familiar problem domain, you  found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.**

> The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.

# What can you do about it?
### If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

* Make the problem domain easier
* Get better at understanding the problem domain

> You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

*What I mean by this is that it is often beneficial to take a part of the problem and fully understand that part before expanding the problem domain.*

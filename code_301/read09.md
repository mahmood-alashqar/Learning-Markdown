## So then, what is Functional Programming?


### Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions. These functions take input which is called as arguments then shows the output based on the inputs being taken which, given the same input always results in the same output.
### It doesn’t allow any mutation nor shared state, as functions should remain pure and true to their expression under this paradigm. It is declarative rather than imperative/procedural.


### You could also say that Functional Programming was simply a bunch of functions that don’t allow outside scope nor mutation of objects. Rather than we mutate arrays by adding/removing inside the scope to achieve a solution like OOP does, functional is pure, straightforward and doesn’t mutate. It presents an answer to its elegant function in a straightforward manner.


### It’s also worth noting that JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language and Functional Programming is one of them. Just because it’s capable of declaring functions doesn’t mean you’re using the paradigm. It needs to observe proper implementation to fully use it.

## Features of Functional Programming

### We can’t discuss the benefits of Functional Programming without discussing its features. Here are some of the most notable features of Functional Programming:

## First-Class Citizen Functions

### What’s good about Functional Programming is its functions are first-class citizens: you can always insert functions inside a function without any restrictions present.

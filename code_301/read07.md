# REST : 
Roy Thomas Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.
### Web Services:
web services include any software, application, or cloud technology that provides standardized web protocols (HTTP or HTTPS) to interoperate, communicate, and exchange data messaging – usually XML (Extensible Markup Language) – throughout the internet.

3. PUT:The HTTP PUT method is used to update an existing record in the data source in the RESTful architecture. So let's create an action method in our StudentController to update an existing student record in the database using Entity Framework. The action method that will handle HTTP PUT request must start with a word Put.

# Loops
in loops a code will run only, if a condition is returned true, and it will keep running this code until the condition returns false
we will discuss two types of loops, the for loop and the while loop
for llops are most common. the condition of this type is based on a counter, for the loop is intended to run several times. when this counter reaches its end, then the condition will become false and the loop ends
loops:
loops check condition it is true will run the block code ,and will keep checking until it retun false. There are three types of loops

for:to tell the loop how much time should check use ccondition as counter counter.
while: will keep running till give me true condition.
do while: will run the statment inside {} at least once even its fault.
loop counter ++for++ :
has three statment after variable call it i :

intilization:i=0 will act like counter
condition:i<number that will run till specific number. we can name varible here instade of number
update :i++ will add one every time condition will run it also can count down --

# Array
Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.

Arrays cannot use strings as element indexes (as in an associative array) but must use integers. Setting or accessing via non-integers using bracket notation (or dot notation) will not set or retrieve an element from the array list itself, but will set or access a variable associated with that array's object property collection. The array's object properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations cannot be applied to these named properties.


# Import

a lot of programmer before made thiungs for us ready and just we have to call there code using import to use it
